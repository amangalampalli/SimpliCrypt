 # SimpiCrypt by Aditya Mangalampalli!
 
 ## Why this project ? ##
 
 Growing up, my family did not have much money, so my first ever computer was a Raspberry Pi. With the advantages of the device running Linux and having full customization, I was in love with it. A few months later, one of my friend's home network was compromised by some hackers and they happened to steal a lot of sensitive documents and data. Seeing this, this got me thoroughly interested in Cybersecurity and how data that is meant to be private, stays private. Ever since then, I have beenfalling deeper and deeper into the Cybersecurity rabbit-hole and have started to learn more about encryption and other data-safety practices. It's still funny to me how using that Raspberry Pi and prodding around with the WiFi connection led me to where I am now. This project is an attempt to help teach others the concepts behind encryption so they better know what happens to data sent over the internet.
 
 ## Thank you for your time!
