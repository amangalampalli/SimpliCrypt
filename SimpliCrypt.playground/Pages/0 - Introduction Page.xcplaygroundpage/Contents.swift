 # Welcome to SimpiCrypt by Aditya Mangalampalli!
 This  is a quick demonstration of how internet cryptopgrahy works.

 This demonstrates a specific type of encryption called R.S.A. What is R.S.A. you might ask?
 R.S.A. stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman who invented this technique of encryption.
 RSA is an asymetrical crptographic technique also known as public key cryptography.
 Public key encryption derives from a set of public keys and private keys and... don't worry too much about it, we'll cover it soon :)
 It uses a pair of keys to encrypt and decrypt the data but this will become clearer with the hands-on demonstration.
 
 Note: This is a CLI (Command Line Interface)  based app so be sure to check the console to get the full experience!
